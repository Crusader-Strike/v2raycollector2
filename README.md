### 2. Configuration

Create a file named `channels.txt` in the same directory as the script. Add the public Telegram channel names you want to scrape into this file, with each channel name on a new line.

Lines starting with `#` and empty lines will be ignored.

**Example `channels.txt`:**

```txt
# This is a comment, it will be ignored
V2rayCollector
another_channel

# You can add as many channels as you want
some_other_v2ray_channel
